monopoly_ai.py

Utilities for computing landing probabilities (Markov chain) and a fast
heuristic to recommend house/hotel builds using those probabilities.

This file is written to integrate with your existing project structure:
- It expects the board list you provided in `board.py` (40 tiles)
- It uses your `Property` class methods (calculate_rent, add_house, add_hotel, etc.)

Provided classes / functions:
- dice_distribution(): distribution of two-dice sums (2..12)
- MarkovChain(board, chance_jail_prob=1/6, cc_jail_prob=1/6): builds transition
  matrix and computes stationary distribution (landing probabilities)
- top_build_recommendations(player, landing_probs, max_builds): quick heuristic
  that returns an ordered list of (Property, expected_income_gain, will_be_hotel)
- apply_build_plan(player, plan, min_reserve=150): apply builds while keeping reserve

Notes / simplifications:
- Chance / Community Chest are modelled using the simplified card set in your
  draw_card(): ~1/6 chance to send to jail, otherwise they do not move the player.
- Jail behaviour is simplified: being in jail has a 1/6 chance to release each turn
  (rolling doubles) and 5/6 to stay. This underestimates the real chance of leaving
  by paying after 3 turns but is fast and useful for heuristics.
- The Markov chain assumes standard movement (sum of two dice) and handles the
  "Go To Jail" square by forcing moves to jail.

Next steps I can implement (if you want):
- Replace simplifications with a fuller jail-state model (tracks jail turn counts)
- Wrap the game into a Gym-like RL environment (state vector, step(), reset())
- Add a baseline RL agent (tabular / DQN) for the building decision
